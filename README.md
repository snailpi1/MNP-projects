# MNP-projects

A collection of modelling methods and projects.

## Study of a Chaotic System

_SystèmeChaotique_ is a study of the predictability of the limits of a dynamical system represented by population growth as a function of various parameters. The stability of the system is analysed using Lyapunov exponents to quantify the rate of seperation of infinitesimally close limits and to isolate variables to which the system is sensitive.

## Global Warming

_Rechauffement_ is a project on extracting statistically significant evidence of temperature increase from weather data from the Montélimar weather station in the south of France between 1920 and 2019. Temperature variation is modelled using different functions, which are then tested for statistically significant parameters. An estimated increase of 1.5 C is found.

## Chaotic Nature of a Pendulum

_Pendule_ is a study on the chaotic behaviour of a pendulum once often simplified constraints are removed, such as the small angle approximation. The model is treated with the 4th order Runge-Kutta method of solving second order non-linear differential equations.

## Digue

This project is a quantitative study of the equilibrium conditions of a dam following different contours of the supporting wall. The problem is treated in a two dimensional hydrostatic case with a constant height constraint. The goal is to impliment a numerical method of solving a differential problem.

## Perceived Retrograde Movement

_Mouvement Retrograde de Mars_ contains a study on the inevitability of perceived retrograde movements of Mars as seen from Earth using a simplified two dimensional model.
